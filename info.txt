# Usage:
		<pre>./nuggetName/nuggetName --type=<TYPE> --file=<PATH_TO_FILE></pre>
		<pre>./nuggetName/nuggetName --uuid=<UUID> --file=<PATH_TO_FILE></pre>
	Specifying a TYPE/UUID is not obligatory as only some nuggets require them.
	Note that the type/uuid of files must be specified BEFORE the file argument. Every file which is specified after a UUID argument will have that UUID assigned to it. In order to specify a different UUID for subsequent files use a second UUID argument.
	<pre>./nuggetName/nuggetName --uuid=<UUID> --file=<PATH_TO_FILE> --uuid=<UUID> --file=<PATH_TO_FILE></pre>
	Nuggets that require a TYPE/UUID specification:

# [swfScanner]
# Dependencies (a dependency of my dependency is also my dependency, but I won't list them here):
#*	uuid uuid-dev
#*	libconfig-dev
#*	libssl-dev libssl0.9.8
# Compilation switches: -luuid -lssl -lconfig -lpthread -lrt -lm
# Configuration: no configuration necessary.
# Information provided by clamavNugget:
#* if compiled with VERBOSE defined the nugget prints (using printf):
#** printRECT - prints found RECT objects
#** printHEADER - swf header information
#** printTAGs - prints located swf tags
#* Metadata_Add_string (called via Metadata_Add_CVE).
#* Metadata_Add_string (called via Metadata_Add_BID).
#* Razorback_Render_Vertict (called with judgement containing warning messages: 'Warning:<WARNINGS>').
#* Razorback_Render_Vertict (called with judgement containing message '<THREAT>').

# [clamavNugget]
# Dependencies (a dependency of my dependency is also my dependency, but I won't list them here):
#*	uuid uuid-dev
#*	libssl-dev
#*	libconfig-dev
# Compilation switches: -luuid -lssl -lconfig -lpthread -lrt
# Required for running:
#*	clamav-daemon
# Configuration:
#* Sample 'clamav.conf' must be placed in '/etc/hsn2/razorback/'
#* Modify configuration of clamd ('/etc/clamav/clamd.conf') manually or using dpkg-reconfigure clamav-base
#* Nugget requires TCP connection.
#* if clamav user is different than root then make sure files for scanning is accessible. 
#* After changing configuration restart/start clamav-daemon.
# Information provided by clamavNugget:
#* Metadata_Add_string (called via Metadata_Add_MalwareName - with constant 2nd argument "ClamAv" as vendor).
#* Razorback_Render_Vertict (called with judgement containing message ClamAV Found: <THREAT>).

# [virusTotal]
# Dependencies (a dependency of my dependency is also my dependency, but I won't list them here):
#*	uuid uuid-dev
#*	libconfig-dev
#*	libcurl4-openssl-dev
#*	libjson0-dev
# Configuration: no configuration necessary.
# Information provided by virusTotal:
#* Metadata_Add_string (called via Metadata_Add_MalwareName - with reporing AV engine as vendor).
#* Metadata_Add_string (called via  Metadata_Add_Report) with a fairly readable report containing when the file corresponding to the hash was first subbmited and what detections were reported for it.
#* Razorback_Render_Vertict (called with judgement containing message 'VirusTotal reported block bad' or 'VirusTotal nothing found' ).
# Important note: The nugget only checks if the file's MD5 has a report in VirusTotal. The file isn't actually scanned.



# [archiveInflate]
# Dependencies (a dependency of my dependency is also my dependency, but I won't list them here):
#*	uuid uuid-dev
#*	libconfig-dev
#*	libssl-dev
#*	libarchive-dev
# Configuration: no configuration necessary.
# Information provided by archiveInflate:
#* Metadata_Add_string (called via Metadata_Add_Filename) with the name of the extracted file (once per file/directory). Currently don't see any reasonable way to detect if the string refers to a file or a directory.
#* calls Submission_Submit which in turn calls File_Store to save the output file (once per file/directory). What happens with the file is dependant on the implementation of File_Store (currently files saved to /tmp).
# Important note: This nugget doesn't actually do any inspection. It performs archive extraction.

Configuration for execution:
	Currently nugget conf files are required to be in the '/etc/hsn2/razorback' directory.
	Conf files contain information such as script location, api keys etc.
